The **Effective Variance Attention-enhanced Diffusion Model (EVADM)** is designed to enhance the resolution and quality of aerial imagery, particularly focusing on high-resolution cropland images. By leveraging emerging diffusion models (DM) and introducing the Variance-Average-Spatial Attention (VASA) mechanism, EVADM significantly improves image super-resolution (SR) tasks.

## Main Contributions

- **Development of the CropSR Dataset**: Created a high-resolution aerial image dataset, namely CropSR, with over 321,000 samples for self-supervised SR training.
- **Introduction of Variance-Average-Spatial Attention (VASA)**: Designed a novel attention mechanism inspired by the trend of decreasing image variance with increasing flight altitude, enhancing SR model performance.
- **Efficient VASA-enhanced Diffusion Model (EVADM)**: Developed a robust model that leverages VASA to improve the quality of aerial imagery super-resolution.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**: Introduced the Super-Resolution Relative Fidelity Index (SRFI) for a nuanced assessment of structural and perceptual similarities in SR outputs.

## Dataset

### CropSR (for training)
- **Description**: A high-resolution aerial image dataset comprising over 321,000 samples for self-supervised SR training.

### CropSR-FP/OR (for real-SR testing)
- **Description**: A combined dataset constructed from matched orthomosaic mapping (CropSR-OR) and fixed-point photographs (CropSR-FP).
- **Total Pairs**: More than 5,000 pairs.
- The test datasets can be accessed at [CropSR (for Crop Field Aerial Image Super Resolution), Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fhvph562cn).

## Model Performance
  - Achieved a FID reduction of 14.6, and 27% boost of SRFI for √ó2 real SR datasets.
  - Achieved a FID reduction of 8.0, and 6% boost of SRFI for √ó4 real SR datasets.

## Generalization Ability

EVADM has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities on the open **Agriculture-Vision** dataset, highlighting its robustness across various aerial imagery tasks.
