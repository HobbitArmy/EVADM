
# This code are based on [LDM (Latent Diffusion Models)](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion)

**1. please refer to LDM for installation and usage.**
[**LDM paper: High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752)<br/>

**2. the main difference is additional model files under ldm/modules/diffusionmodules/ ,and you can just copy and replace after installing LDM.**

**3. please download the [weights file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1os4pK0CfyjW96FphApZpTjBziltEiTyz?usp=drive_link) to weights/**

**4. start by runing eva101_EVADM_infer.py**
